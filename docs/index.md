I'm a developer with a day-job in academia. I've been a freelance web designer and a developer, and now I have a focus on some free and open source projects I've been running for a while. I'm also a Linux enthusiast and a junior user of emacs, for my sins.

This page is intended to collect together my projects and also host a blog covering dev and FOSS related issues. Maybe you'll like it. Maybe you won't. Maybe you've never seen this website and I'm just talking to the void. But, the void sometimes speaks back. Maybe.
