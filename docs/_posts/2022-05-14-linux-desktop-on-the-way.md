title: Chrome or GNU, the year of the Linux Desktop is coming

A spectre is haunting the home desktop. The spectre of the Linux desktop.
Words to these effect have been thrown around for at least a decade now, and each
time Linux not made its way into the drives of Western home PCs. I, like most
people, have dismissed "the year of the linux desktop" as a meme, and for
good reasons. However, I think the meme is about to become reality
(either that or reality is about to become a meme).

This is not because of some great change made in the GNU/Linux world.
Although, there have been countless incremental changes over the last
few years that mean I no longer have to cross my fingers when using
linux for something time-sensitive or involving collaboration with non-linux
colleagues and friends (i.e., everyone I know). These improvements are,
what I would call, in my day job, "necessary conditions" for a linux
take over, but not "sufficient conditions". They need to be there, but
they won't take us over the edge.

No, the reason is that Windows has finally become so resource intensive
that it can't run on affordable hardware for ordinary people. The cost of
everything is going up. And, in my role as informal tech-broker for my
friends and family, I find it increasingly hard to recommend a Windows
laptop under £600 that can be trusted to do what most of them want:
word processing, web browsing, emails and spreadsheets.

This problem cropped up on my radar around the release of Windows 10,
when laptops were released with 4GB of RAM, when the minimum
requirements for x64 Windows 10 was... 4GB of RAM. These machines
barely met the spec., and given the resource intensive nature of modern
web browsers, they would barely function because the OS required so
much memory to give you the basics.

Attempts to strip down Windows (10S and 10X) reduced the included price
of the OS, arguably leading to better value, but not performance, failing
to address the rising tide of Chromebooks. I no longer recommend any
Windows laptops under £600, and even then, the prospect is not great.
And, despite the common belief in "apple tax", those 2020 M1 Macbook
Airs look extremely good value these days at around £800.

But still, when your friend who has a Windows 7 laptop they bought for
£350 in 2012, that coped with the upgrade to windows 10 because it was
sold with 8GB of DDR3 ram, asks you for a laptop recommendation,
they're unlikely to be happy with the suggestion that they need a Macbook
Air, if they want a mature commercial OS. Instead, the best bet is to
support them with the transition to a Chromebook, whose support for
GNU/Linux apps is surprisingly simple to set up and stable. That's pretty
close to the year of the linux desktop to me. Okay, it's not full-fat
GNU/Linux, and its not a gaming platform., but it is a Linux desktop OS.

Microsoft seem to have realised this problem themselves with their
controversial decision to refuse to officially support 7th-gen intel and 1st
gen Ryzen or older. Windows is incapable of running well on older and
budget hardware these days, and the experience is going to deteriorate.
I think they're betting hard on powerful budget processors in the coming
generations that will catch up to the bloated mess that Windows has become.

This comes at a cost. The vibrant second-hand market of refurbished old
computers for example, which are perfectly capable, even with Windows 10,
to perform most everyday computing tasks, will lose support. This will, when
Win10 reaches end of life, screw over at least one of my actually-existing
friends with a 2015 ThinkPad that works fine for him. Unless he drops it,
it shows no sign of ceasing to function in 2025, and yet it will suddenly
become a security threat just because Microsoft have arbitrarily drawn a line
in the sand. He'll have a choice: spend a fortune on a new Mac or PC, buy
a Chromebook, or install GNU/Linux. I'm sure you can guess which one I'll be
encouraging him to try first. Unfortunately, while I think I can get him to like
LibreOffice, I think he'll struggle without iTunes.

This goes to the heart of the strength of free and open source software: if
the creator doesn't want to support some piece of hardware, the community can
take it over. If iTunes and the iPod drivers were open source, that friend could
use his iPod classic forever, and its precious metals would never end up in a
landfill. Thankfully, an alternative exists for his sturdy tank of a laptop, so it
should hang on for a few more years.

In short, the year of the linux desktop is coming, not because of Valve and the
Steamdeck, not because of Nvidia open-sourcing its drivers, but because the choice
between spending £600 to replace equipment, during a cost of living crisis, that
is working perfectly and learning to use new software is no choice at all, no more
than the choice between spending £600 to use Microsoft Office rather than £200
to buy a Chromebook and use the Google office suite. The only thing that can
happen to stop it, is for Microsoft to make a U-turn. Which they probably will,
to be fair.
