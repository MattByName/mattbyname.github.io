As a sufferer of [visual stress](http://www.learningwithdyslexia.co.uk/visual-stress-and-dyslexia/) related to dyspraxia and dyslexia, I find tinted glasses and colour overlays extremely helpful for reading. Software overlays, which tint the whole desktop with a colour, are also helpful, and mean I don't have to wear my very dark and expensive [Irlen](https://irlen.com) lenses, which I can't always afford to renew with my prescription anyway. 

On Windows, I use [WindowShades](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Desktop-Enhancements/Other-Desktop-Enhancements/WindowShades.shtml). On Mac, I used a similar app that I can't remember the name of. When I started using Linux, however, there was only one option, [Gnome Tint](https://github.com/apenugon/gnome-tint), a GNOME Shell extension. Luckily, I was using GNOME at the time. However, when the project fell out of maintenance without a FOSS licence, I set to re-implementing it as [ColorTint](https://github.com/MattByName/color-tint) in early 2019.

I'm now also working on a new implementation for KDE Plasma, [KolorTint](https://github.com/MattByName/kolor-tint), as I've recently switched to that for my sins. As my desktop development skills increase, I will try to make a desktop-environment-independent solution, as I want this feature to be as widely available as possible, aiming towards a more accessible GNU/Linux.
